      To ensure our application is stable and secure, we utilize third-party
      monitoring services to collect technical
      diagnostics and usage data. This includes information such as device type,
      operating system version, crash reports, and software update status.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-8 text-base/8">
      This data is used solely for functional purposes: to diagnose technical
      issues, monitor app performance, and ensure security. It is collected in a
      pseudonymized or aggregated format and is not used for marketing,
      profiling, or to identify individual users personally. We do not sell this
      data to third parties.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-8 text-base/8">
      We generally retain technical diagnostic data for 90 days to identify and fix app bugs, after which it is automatically deleted from our third-party service providers.

      We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating
